            <button class="accordion">Can I really start with no previous martial arts experience? </button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Yes! The vast majority of those who join our club have never learned a martial art before. We will
                    help you to learn safely and comfortably. You will be shown each step of each technique clearly, as
                    often as needed. </p>
                <br>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Do I need to wear one of those white suits? </button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>It's not necessary to wear a white suit ("keikogi") to train with us. If you do wish to purchase a
                    suit, and you are a student, the club can order it for you and will usually pay part of the cost.
                </p>

            <button class="accordion">What kind of events can I expect? </button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>As well as weekly practice, MU Aikido Club takes part in larger training courses with other
                    practitioners of aikido. The first such event each academic year is usually a beginners' course
                    which takes place over a weekend in Galway. Additionally the club enjoys a few social dinners over
                    the course of the academic year. While COVID-19 has prevented us from taking part in these events
                    over the past couple of years, we look forward to the opportunity to resume them. Images of these
                    events, along with pictures of general training, can be seen in our <a href="gallery.html"

            <div class="panel">
                <p>Most members of MU Aikido Club are students or alumni of Maynooth University. MU staff (and students,
                    staff, and alumni of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth) can also join. If you don't meet any of these
                    criteria, we suggest Gyo Fu Kan, the central dojo of the <a
