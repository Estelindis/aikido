# About the project
The MU Aikido Club website is designed to inform users about aikido broadly and the MU Aikido Club specifically.  Ideally, even a user who was not interested in aikido before visiting the site might become interested via browsing it. 

## User Goals
- Navigate easily through a clear, readable website with attractive colours and images.
- Learn what aikido is.
- Learn who can join the MU Aikido Club.
- Find training times and locations.
- See what aikido practice is like and what other club activities take place. 
- Join the club.

## Owner Goals
- Explain what aikido is.
- Emphasize that MU Aikido Club is a beginners' club with no experience required.
- Communicate when the club trains and how to get to the training venue.
- Display club experiences (training, courses, and social events). 
- Provide a way for interested users to join immediately.
- Convey aspects of the history and culture of aikido without overwhelming the user.

# Website structure
![Website look on multiple devices.](/assets/image-readme/responsive-index.jpg)

## Navigation 
- The club logo navigates back to the index. 
- The nav bar allows the user to navigate between all pages of the website.
- The nav bar uses the same font as the logo and headings: Yuji Syuku.  This font is also used for the aikido kanji displayed on the index hero image.  This provides a unified look.  At the same time, the choice of a serif font for  logo, nav bar, and headings clearly distinguishes them from the rest of the content (which uses a sans serif font).   
- Font colour used in navigation contrasts with the background.  On the FAQ page, when a small screen would cause the nav bar to float above a different background colour, the font colour is reversed to maintain contrast.
- Additionally, the index's main article links to the Join page under the heading "How Do I Join?"

## Header
- The club logo is clear and simple: text without any icons or images.   
- Excluding the Gallery, each page has a single main image directly below the logo.  Each image is chosen to complement the logo rather than to distract from it.

## Index Main Article
- The index main article is divided with the following headings: "Learn Aikido at Maynooth"; "Why Aikido?"; and "How Do I Join?"  These were chosen as the most important pieces of information to communicate to a new user of the site.
- Under "Learn Aikido at Maynooth" .
- Under "Why Aikido?" .
- Under "How Do I Join?" .

## Training Times Sidebar
- This sidebar contains the days and times for MU Aikido Club training sessions, as well as the location of these sessions.  Further information about how to reach the location is found in the FAQ, but this basic information is placed prominently due to its importance.  It will be relevant both to new users and returning users who may have attended some training sessions previously but forgotten the place and/or time.  
- This sidebar is present both on the Index page and the FAQ page, due to the importance of the information therein.

## News Sidebar
- This sidebar contains updates, such as COVID-19 protocols and upcoming courses.  It is intended primarily for returning users, but may be of interest to new users. 
- This sidebar is present both on the Index page and the FAQ page, due to its importance.

## Footer
- The footer section on each page contains a quote from aikido founder Morihei Ueshiba.  These quotes communicate essential qualities of the spirit of aikido.  They are chosen to encourage prospective members that everyone can learn something from aikido and that perfection is neither expected nor demanded.
- Social media icons in the footer link to Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.  Specific rather than general placeholder links were chosen because the MU Aikido Club is a real, living organization that is part of a wider infrastructure of organizations.  
- At the MU Aikido Club Facebook page, users can see more photos and find updates on additional practice sessions.  
- At the MU Twitter page, users can see if the sports facilities used by the MU Aikido Club have been closed due to any emergency.  
- At the International Aikido Federation YouTube page, users can see examples of aikido practice.  This page is affiliated with the Aikikai Foundation.  By linking to this page, the site communicates to those aware of multiple aikido organizations that MU Aikido Club practises Aikikai (the original school of aikido), without going into details that might confuse or alienate a new user.  
- The colour scheme of the footer is inverted compared with the rest of the website, to provide a pleasing element of contrast.

## FAQ 
- The FAQ answers common questions that users may have about the MU Aikido Club.  It is intended mainly for new users, but may be of some help to returning users.
- The first questions are meant to address urgent concerns of new users, especially worries that may lead users to disengage from the site.  At first, users may be intimidated by the thought of trying a martial art, or wearing specific clothing that may seem strange.  As the answers to these questions hopefully assuage users' concerns, questions turn to more tangible issues, like who qualifies to join the club and how to get to the training venue.
- The accordion style of the FAQ follows the method laid out at [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp).  While the style is adapted to suit the look of the MU Aikido Club site, the accordion script itself comes directly from this source.

## Colours
The colours used throughout the site for its main styling are shown below. They are complimented by more colorful background image to give the website consistent, clean look. These colors and background were intentionally picked to keep the modern, simple design. They compliment each other well and keep great page contrast, which makes it more user-friendly and readable. 

## Typography
Two fonts are used throughout the website.  These fonts are unified by their clear legibility, with differences in the serif font that draw attention to headers and other important elements.
- [Yuji Syuku](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yuji+Syuku) - logo, navigation, headers, and kanji.  Of the Google fonts that include kanji, this one most closely resembles the brush style seen on Aikido scrolls in dojos around the world.  It is somewhat artistic but still clear to read.  A subtle inked look carries over to the logo, nav bar, and headings, unifying them with the kanji reading "aikido" on the index page.
- [Barlow Semi Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Semi+Condensed) - an elegant, easy-to-read sans-serif font.

## Icons and images
- The source for the icons used in the footer is [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
- The source for the hero image in the index page is [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/red-and-gray-pagoda-temple-3408354/).  Tomáš Malík's photo of Mt. Fuji was chosen to represent the Japanese origin of aikido.  It further implies that practising a martial art is like climbing a mountain.  Using GIMP, I edited the photo to replace the sky with a solid fill of the main background colour of the website, for a cleaner look.  Editing Pexels photos is permitted by their terms of use.   
- The source for the main FAQ image is [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/aikido-dojo-asian-style-flat-vector-1196646862).  Natamura's vector image evokes a typical Japanese dojo as well as the main aikido dojo in Dublin on Macken Street.  I edited the image to replace the tatami with the main background colour of the website, as well as somewhat extending the picture to the sides for very wide screens.  I licensed this image via free trial, which allows usage rights to be retained after the trial ends, even if the trial is cancelled immediately.  [Editing licensed content is permitted by Shutterstock.](https://support.shutterstock.com/s/article/Can-I-edit-the-content-I-license?language=en_US)
- The main Join image was also licensed from [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/white-judogi-folded-tied-belt-1688098678).  The photo of a white suit and belt by maRRitch was chosen to encourage prospective members to put on a suit and join the club (many members choose to wear the suits, even if they are not required).  The white belt communicates that all club members train together with a "beginners' spirit," even those with the right to wear a black belt.
- The image of the Sports Centre floor map was created from scratch by me in GIMP.

# Testing
## [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator.

No errors were returned when passing through the official Jigsaw validator. 

## [Lighthouse accessibility (Chrome DevTools)](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)
I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easily readable and accessible by running it through Lighthouse in DevTools (both mobile and desktop versions).

## Manual testing
- I tested that the website works in different browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox.
- I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar and manually testing the page on different devices (laptops, tablet, iPhone and three different Android smartphones).

# Bugs and fixes
## Solved bugs
- (Smaller media query to make scrollbar vanish on iPhone).
- (Browser query to give alternate hero image and video for Safari users).
