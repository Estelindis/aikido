            <br>
            <p>We at Maynooth University Aikido Club welcome you to join us on the journey of fitness, friendship, and personal growth.  We have been active at MU for over 20 years, with an excellent record of training and extracurricular events. We are primarily a beginners' club with no previous experience required.  Don't hesitate to come to a class and try training, to see if it's for you. </p><br>
            <h2 class="centred index-heading">Why Aikido?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Aikido is a Japanese martial art.  Its aim is to defend oneself without harming the attacker, if possible.  Aikido focuses on throws and locks, applied defensively against striking or grabbing attackers.  It blends with the momentum of the attack, rather than fighting against it, and thus does not require high levels of physical strength.  It is suitable for people of all fitness levels.  In addition to gaining self-defence skills, those who practise aikido report improved flexibility, aerobic health, and mental wellbeing. </p><br>
            <h2 class="centred index-heading">How Do I Join?</h2>
            <br>
            <p><a href="join.html"><u>Sign up here</u></a>, then come to any class (times and locations in the sidebar).  You do not need any special equipment, just a willingness to learn.  Wear loose, comfortable clothing (e.g. t-shirt and tracksuit bottoms; we do not recommend shorts). </p><br>

            <br>
            <p>To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, we now train in pods of no more than six students (plus sensei).  In classes with more than six students, members divide into pods and do not practise techniques with those outside their pod.</p>  
            <br>
            <p>While restrictions continue, please wear a mask when walking the corridors of the sports hall.  Members may wear a mask while training if they wish, but it is not required.</p>
